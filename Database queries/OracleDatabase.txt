-- This query retrieves the configuration of operating system authentication prefixes and remote OS authentication.
-- It's important to review these settings as they control how Oracle interacts with OS-level authentication, which can have security implications.

SELECT * FROM V$PARAMETER
WHERE name = 'os_authent_prefix'
      OR name = 'remote_os_authent';

-- This query retrieves the configuration of operating system roles and remote OS roles.
-- OS roles should be carefully managed, and remote OS role management should typically be disabled to prevent security risks.

-- This query lists all users in the database.
-- Regularly reviewing the list of database users helps ensure that only authorized users have access and that accounts are managed according to security policies.

SELECT * FROM DBA_USERS;

-- This query lists all profiles in the database, which are collections of resource limits and password parameters for users.
-- Reviewing profiles helps ensure that they are configured to enforce security policies, such as password complexity and resource usage limits.

SELECT * FROM DBA_PROFILES;

-- This query retrieves the source code for password verification functions used in profiles.
-- Reviewing the password verification function helps ensure that it enforces strong password policies as per security best practices.

-- This query lists users who have default passwords, which is a significant security risk.
-- Users with default passwords should change their passwords immediately to prevent unauthorized access.

SELECT * FROM DBA_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD;

-- This query lists all role privileges granted to users and roles.
-- Regularly auditing role privileges helps ensure that users have only the necessary permissions, following the principle of least privilege.

SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS;

-- This query lists all system privileges granted to users and roles.
-- System privileges grant powerful database-wide operations, so they should be granted sparingly and only to trusted users.

SELECT * FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS;

-- This query lists users who have SYSDBA or SYSOPER privileges.
-- These privileges allow for full control over the database and should be restricted to a minimal number of highly trusted users.
